RTS is a student-led robotics association based in Télécom Physique Strasbourg, an engineering school located in Illkirch, in the southern periphery of Strasbourg, also affiliated with the Institut Mines-Télécom and part of Strasbourg's University.

We are taking part every year to the French Robotics Cup (See [cup](/cup/)), and running projects throughout the year in order to train ourselves in the field surrounding Robotics, such as Electronics, Automation or Computer Vision. We also are offering our support to students in their personnal or school-related projects.
